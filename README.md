# 1 GAM challenge

[Original post](http://alexyshegmann.com/one-game-a-month-challenge/)

I just found out there’s [a challenge](http://www.onegameamonth.com/) in which you have to create a game each month. Not your best game, not even a good game, just a game. #1GAM!

We all have gone through that vicious cycle: you have a great idea and you get excited; you start planning out the next big thing, draw a few mock ups, even write the first draft of the GDD; you start hitting the keyboard and create a few parts of the system… then you have some other priorities and the big game starts to pile dust; then a new idea comes and the cycle starts all over again.

Creating awesome games takes time, sometimes more than we would want or expect —just ask Phil Fish about Fez—. But just ask yourself: how many games have I really finished in my gamedev career? I myself can only think of four. I’m not a full time gamedev, but nevertheless this is a ridiculous amount taking into account I started doing this when I was 9.

And this goes beyond creating games. I have a Trello dashboard dedicated to my projects with a list called “Vault [take one when free]” for all my next million dollars ideas. But this queue never gets consumed (damn).

So I’ve decided I’ll take the challenge (because January, you know). I might not be able to pull off a game each month, maybe not even a cute demo, but I’ll try. I’ll schedule some time each month to at least write an isolated interesting algorithm (inspired by Daniel Shiffman‘s Coding Challenges). I created a category just for this, so stay tuned.
